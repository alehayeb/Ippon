# ADR-001: Adopt a Phased Approach for AI Developer Hub Development

**Date**: 2024-07-15

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

The development of the AI Developer Hub is a complex undertaking with multiple dependencies and a broad scope. A monolithic, all-at-once approach would be high-risk and difficult to manage. A phased approach allows for incremental development, feedback, and adaptation.

## Decision

We will adopt a phased approach for the development of the AI Developer Hub. Each phase will have a specific focus, deliverables, and success criteria. This will allow us to de-risk the project, deliver value incrementally, and incorporate feedback throughout the development lifecycle.

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
    - Reduced risk of project failure.
    - Early delivery of value.
    - Continuous feedback and improvement.
    - Better alignment with evolving business needs.

- **Negative**:
    - Longer overall project timeline.
    - Potential for integration challenges between phases.
